# WaterQuality

The problem regarding water quality & anomaly detection will be solved using 2 following methods for optimization:-
1. Genetic Algorithm
2. Cooperative Coevolution

When the optimization process is done, a classifier algorithm will be used to classify the target for the given dataset and finally f1 score will be calculated to measure the effectiveness of the work.
